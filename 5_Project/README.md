# 🚀 Deep Learning Project with PyTorch Fine-Tuning: Two Datasets, Two Challenges 🎯

❗ __**This is a solo project. Collaboration with others is strictly not allowed.**__ ❗

---

## 📅 Key Dates & Deadlines

- **Event Date**: _2023.07.17 (MON)_. Mark your calendars for an afternoon session starting at 14:00 or 15:00.

---

## 📋 1. Project Brief

- You will independently build two distinct Deep Learning models using PyTorch for fine-tuning, each tailored to a unique Kaggle dataset.

- Although you have the freedom to select any model, remember to keep the core framework as PyTorch.

## 💡 2. Project Objectives

### 🔑 Essential Goals:

1. **Detailed Data Analysis**: Delve deep into each dataset. Understand their structure, characteristics, and unique patterns.

2. **Deep Learning Model Design**: Based on your understanding of the datasets, design an effective deep learning model suited for each one.

### 🏹 Optional Goals:

1. **Model Performance Improvement**: Aim high. Explore different techniques and strategies to enhance your models' performance.

## 🗃️ 3. Datasets

Your journey will be with the following Kaggle datasets:

- 🦋 [Butterfly Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phucthaiv02/butterfly-image-classification?select=train) 📸 

- 🍔🍟 [McDonal's Store Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/mcdonalds-store-reviews)📝

### 🚧 Attention 🚧

- Your gateway to the datasets is through the `kaggle api`. Ensure to download them using this tool.
- Windows OS isn't the preferred route; it has known compatibility issues with the `kaggle api`.

---

## 💻 4. Pre-trained Models

Equip yourself wisely for each dataset. You can select any pre-trained model from:

1. [**Pytorch**](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html)

2. [**Huggingface**](https://huggingface.co/models)

for the fine-tuning process.

> Note: You should use a different pre-trained model than the one you used in your Kaggle code.

## 🎙️ 5. Project Presentation & Submission

### 📥 Submission Guidelines:

- Commit and push your project code to [**Github**](www.github.com).
- **Deadline Alert**: The deadline is *2023.07.16 (SUN) 23:59*. Make sure to submit by then!

### 🎓 Presentation Essentials:

Prepare two separate presentations, one for each model. Ensure to logically and comprehensively cover:

1. **Data Analysis**: Reveal your findings from the data investigation.
2. **Data Pre-processing**: Discuss your techniques and processes used for data preprocessing.
3. **Model Architecture**: Unveil your model design and justify the choices made.
4. **Model Performance**: Present a thorough analysis of your model's performance, supported with metrics and visualizations.
5. **Conclusion**: Summarize your key learnings, experiences, and potential future improvements.

> 📊 Note: Visual representations are compulsory for the data analysis and model performance sections.
