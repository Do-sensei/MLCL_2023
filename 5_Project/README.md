## 📋 1. Project Brief

Sharpen your skills! This challenge pushes you to build two distinct Deep Learning models using the robustness of PyTorch for fine-tuning. Each model will cater to a unique dataset from Kaggle. While you're allowed to select any model, remember the heart of this project is **Designing Deep Learning Models** Independently!

## 💡 2. Project Objectives

### 🔑 Key Goals:

1. **In-Depth Data Analysis**: Don't just scratch the surface; dive deep. Understand the structure, characteristics, and hidden patterns within each dataset.

2. **Tailored Deep Learning Model Design**: With your newfound dataset insights, design and construct an effective deep learning model tailored to the data.

### 🏹 Stretch Goals:

1. **Augment Model Performance**: Strive for excellence. Experiment with diverse techniques and strategies to push the boundaries of your model's performance.

## 🗃️ 3. Datasets

Here's your treasure map for this adventure:

- 🦋 [Butterfly Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phucthaiv02/butterfly-image-classification?select=train) 📸 

- 🍔🍟 [McDonal's Store Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/mcdonalds-store-reviews)📝

### 🚧 Attention 🚧

- Your path to the datasets is via the `kaggle api`. Make sure to download them using this tool.
- Avoid the Windows OS route; it has compatibility issues with the `kaggle api`.

## 💻 4. Pre-trained Models

Choose your armoury wisely for each dataset. Feel free to select any pre-trained model from:

1. [**Pytorch**](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html)

2. [**Huggingface**](https://huggingface.co/models)

for the fine-tuning process.

## 🎙️ 5. Project Presentation & Submission

### 📥 Submission Guidelines:

- Commit and push your project code to [**Github**](www.github.com).
- **Deadline Alert**: Clock strikes twelve on *2023.07.16 (SUN) 23:59*. Don't miss it!

### 🎓 Presentation Essentials:

Prepare two separate presentations, one for each model. Make sure to logically and comprehensively walk through:

1. **Data Analysis**: Unveil your data investigation results.
2. **Data Pre-processing**: Discuss your data grooming techniques and procedures.
3. **Model Architecture**: Illuminate your model design and rationalize your decisions.
4. **Model Performance**: Expose an exhaustive analysis of your model's performance, supplemented with metrics and visualizations.
5. **Conclusion**: Round up with your key takeaways, experiences, and possible routes for future enhancements.

> 📊 Visual data narratives are mandatory for the data analysis and model performance sections.
