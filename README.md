AI Coding Practical Python Training for MLCL

## Prepare your environment💻 (__Very Important__)

1. Install [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your computer
2. Install [Remote-SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension on your Vscode
3. Set the SSH connection to the server
    - [How to connect to the server](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh)
4. Prepare Terminal
    - [MovaXTerm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)
    - Or you want to use
        - Vscode Terminal
        - [Termius](https://termius.com/)
        - [Iterm2](https://iterm2.com/) for Mac
        - etc.

5. Switch to `Github` Pro your Account
    - [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
## 📚 Study 📖
 
- ***Study*** [Pytorch Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/) on your own when you have time

- Develop ***error-solving*** skills

- Get used to the ***terminal environment*** (commands, etc.)

- Get used to the `Github` environment (commit, push, pull, etc.)
    - Whenever possible, work in an ***SSH environment***

❗ __**This is a solo project. Collaboration with others is strictly not allowed.**__ ❗

### 🗃️ Datasets

Your journey will be with the following Kaggle datasets:

1.🦋 [Butterfly Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phucthaiv02/butterfly-image-classification?select=train) 📸 

2.🍔🍟 [McDonal's Store Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/mcdonalds-store-reviews)📝 


- Your gateway to the datasets is through the `kaggle api`. Ensure to download them using this tool.
- Windows OS isn't the preferred route; it has known compatibility issues with the `kaggle api`.


### 💻 Pre-trained Models

Equip yourself wisely for each dataset. You can select any pre-trained model from:

1. [**Pytorch**](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html)

2. [**Huggingface**](https://huggingface.co/models)

> Note: You should use a different pre-trained model than the one you used in your Kaggle code.
